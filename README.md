# Categorical_Encoding_Experimentation
This repo contains code for experimenting with categorical encoding - WoE, Catboost, Target encoder and many more.
Many of these encoders such as Catboost, Target, Leave-one-out are very popular when it comes to encoding a categorical variable with very high cardinlaity.
WoE is very popular for low/high cardinality for Binary classification problem especially with Logistic Regression.
Binary and Ordinal encoder could be useful when encoding an ordinal variable.
